Here you'll find some scripts and snippets showcase some basic/common use cases for freedan.

Before you use it in production you might want to:
- adapt the account selector
- change the upload method
- verify the script matches your needs, e.g. run it in debug mode and have a look into the resulting DataFrames

Adapt the scripts to your own unique needs and get inspired. Let me know if you have ideas, questions or suggestions.
