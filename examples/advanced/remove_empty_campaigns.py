    A script that will delete all empty Campaigns in all accounts.
    A Campaign is considered to be empty if it doesn't contain any AdGroups.

        - adapt the account selector
        - change the upload method
        - verify the script matches your needs, e.g. run it in debug mode and have a look into the resulting DataFrames
