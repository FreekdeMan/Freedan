### Models ###
* Models are the backbone of this framework, since they contain functionality used by multiple scripts in one central place.
* For instance:
    * Decode business logic of Campaign/AdGroupName
    * create objects from meta (e.g. AdGroups, Campaigns, ...)
    * Ease interaction with Marketing APIs
    * Standardize information pulled from various sources (e.g. decode special chars: ä->a, ß->ss, ...)
    * Error handling
    * ...
